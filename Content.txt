			"________________" - My Personal Portfolio 
`					WEBSITE
Hello, I'm a student in grade 10th. 
A younger one for this work, but as we say Age does'nt matter, work matters; I can proudly say that I am a compassionate web developer not 
yet introduced to the market. BUT, I can proudly claim that things I decide once go on prooving them. No one can distract or influence me,
'coz I have that skill to influence anyone.

I'm not there to proove anyone what have I done, My work will do it. You don't need to know my name, just remember I am around you to reach 
anytime for your work and company.

A Message from MY SIDE to all the viewers :-

-  I know you might have a trust issue on those random influencers or people who get there to motivate
   and teach something which isn't even needed, I can assure this that I am also one of from you and you also 
   might know the personal me, but I want to keep my work aside from all those people who are getting under 
   my nose, so I hope you undertand my work and trust me. 
   Otherwise, thank you for visiting my friend. 
   "I am not here to gain respect, if i'm that capable I'll get it"
 		THANK YOU
